# Guide to Advanced React: Forms & RBAC

An interactive educational platform built with Vite and React (TypeScript) that teaches advanced frontend concepts through hands-on exploration. This is not a standard applicationâ€”it's a comprehensive learning tool designed to deconstruct and explain complex form management with React Hook Form and robust Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with CASL.

## ðŸŽ¯ Educational Philosophy

This platform is designed as a guided journey where users learn through interaction, exploration, and detailed explanations. Every feature includes contextual tooltips and explanations that reveal the "how" and "why" behind the implementations.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

### Interactive Learning Paths
- **Master React Hook Form**: Multi-step wizards, dynamic fields, and file uploads
- **Unravel RBAC with CASL**: Role-based permissions with real-time UI adaptation

### Technical Excellence
- **CSS Modules**: Component-level style encapsulation with global theming
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Complete theme switching with CSS variables
- **Fully Responsive**: Seamless experience across all devices
- **Educational Tooltips**: Extensive explanations throughout the interface

## ðŸŽ“ Learning Modules
